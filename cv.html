                Create an online resume as a simple html web page and use at least 5 different css elements on the page. You can deploy it on your myweb.usf.edu site, or the cloud site, though myweb is likely to be the most cost-effective, since it will cost you nothing to host the page there.
                <br />

                Submit a link to your resume. There is no grade deduction for a less-than-great-looking resume page. However, you may like to spend some time so your page reflects your personality.
